## Abstract

UIP stands for Penumbra (UM) Improvement Proposal. A UIP is a design document providing information to the Penumbra community, or describing a new feature for Penumbra or its processes or environment. The UIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The UIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

This UIP describes the recommended process for becoming an UIP editor.

## Specification

### Application and Onboarding Process

Anyone having a good understanding of the UIP standardization and network upgrade process, intermediate level experience on the core side of the Celestia blockchain, and willingness to contribute to the process management may apply to become a UIP editor. Potential UIP editors should have the following skills:

- Good communication skills
- Ability to handle contentious discourse
- 1-5 spare hours per week
- Ability to understand "rough consensus"

The best available resource to understand the UIP process is [UIP-1](./uip-1.md). Anyone desirous of becoming an UIP editor MUST understand this document. Afterwards, participating in the UIP process by commenting on and suggesting improvements to PRs and issues will familliarize the procedure, and is recommended. The contributions of newer editors should be monitored by other UIP editors.

Anyone meeting the above requirements may make a pull request adding themselves as an UIP editor and adding themselves to the editor list in [UIP-1](./uip-1.md). If every existing UIP editor approves, the author becomes a full UIP editor. This should notify the editor of relevant new proposals submitted in the UIPs repository, and they should review and merge those pull requests.
